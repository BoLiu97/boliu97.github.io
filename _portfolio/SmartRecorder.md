**Updates**: Paper submitted to IUI 2023 for review



As automatic interaction trace extraction is a key component to tutorial generation, we seek to tackle the challenges of automatically extracting user interaction traces on smartphones from screencasts. Uniquely, with respect to prior research in this field, we combine computer vision techniques with IMU-based sensing algorithms, and the technical evaluation results show the importance of smartphone IMU data in improving system performance. With the extracted key information of each step, SmartRecorder generates instructional content initially and provides tutorial creators with a tutorial refinement editor designed based on a high recall (99.38%) for key steps to revise the initial instructional content. 

Finally, SmartRecorder generates video tutorials based on refined instructional content. The results of the user study demonstrate that SmartRecorder allows non-experts to create smartphone usage video tutorials with less time and higher satisfaction from recipients.
