## Lullaland
People associate the hospital with things they deem stressful and scary. **When they are in healthcare settings, patients have emotional reactions like anxiety, aggression, and anger mainly because they lack control of their environment.** These emotional responses can increase not only pain sensitivity but also delay important medical treatment, lower efficiency, and also undermine patients’ willingness to continue their healthcare treatment.

## Interview & Suvery

### We interviewed 12 participants, including 6 adults and 6 parents, each for 30 minutes.
We asked them to walk us through the whole experience they had at clinic, and asked their mood changes.

### We also conducted a survey to further prove our insights. We sent out questionnaires online and got 40 results.
#### Q: Feelings about Hospital 
Q: Feelings about Hospital 
#### Q: How to get relaxed
70% of participants reported that they have tried meditation to help get relaxed. 85% of participants said they will need to draw their attention from the anxiety.

Can we use several speakers embroidered on clothes to track body movement? In this project, I experimented with many materials for making embroidered speakers (threads, clothing materials, and coil size). Anandghan and I also designed several circuits for speakers and microphones. Since we are still working on the project, I cannot show much detail on the website. Chat with me about the project!
