------
I am third-year PhD student at Cornell Tech, with the privilege of being co-advised by [Rajalakshmi Nandakumar](https://infosci.cornell.edu/~rajalakshmi/) and [Thijs Roumen](http://thijsroumen.eu/)

Before pursuing my PhD, I earned my Master in [Technology Innovation](https://gix.uw.edu/) at the University of Washington. I conducted research at [Ubicomp Lab](https://ubicomplab.cs.washington.edu/) and [Make4All](https://make4all.org/) advised by Shwetak Patel and Jennifer Mankoff, respectively. 

My research has been focused on wearable devices, sensing, and healthcare. I am passionate how sensing technologies can guide physical assembly processes.
