IBD (Intestinal Bowel Disease) causes pain and lifestyle hindrances for more than 3 million people on a daily basis. While e-health and mobile health applications have been explored as a means to assist patients in managing their disease, the apps still exhibit low uptake (6%) among IBD patients. Therefore, we sought to elucidate the reasons patients do not often use mobile health apps to manage their condition in this qualitative semi-structured interview study with 16 current IBD patients. Qualitative review of these interviews revealed that perceived potential benefit of apps in disease management is counteracted by high cost of use (time-consuming tracking requirements) in the trade-off in current apps.  

Additionally, participants expressed some surmountable personal and social discomfort with using stool-related apps.
Based on these findings, specific suggestions for improvements of gastrointestinal management apps are suggested based on interview feedback from real patients experiencing gastrointestinal disease.
