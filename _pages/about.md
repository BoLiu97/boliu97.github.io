Hi, I am an incoming first-year PhD student at Cornell Tech, with the privilege of being co-advised by [Rajalakshmi Nandakumar](https://infosci.cornell.edu/~rajalakshmi/) and [Thijs Roumen](http://thijsroumen.eu/)

Before pursuing my PhD, I earned my Master in [Technology Innovation](https://gixnetwork.org/) at the University of Washington. I conducted research at [Ubicomp Lab](https://ubicomplab.cs.washington.edu/) and [Make4All](https://make4all.org/) advised by Shwetak Patel and Jennifer Mankoff, respectively. 

My research has been focused on wearable devices, user interface design, and healthcare. I am passionate about e-Textile, AR/VR, and sensing to make a positive impact on people's lives. 

Previously, I worked for one year as a software engineer for chip design verification at Synopsys.
