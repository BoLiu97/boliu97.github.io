Can we use several speakers embroidered on clothes to track body movement?
The current body movement tracking techniques usually includes smartwatch, image processing. However, these are either not accurate or not accessible to use when walking on the street. 
Why we need this
What problem it solves
Why is this better than previous approaches

 In this project, I experimented with many materials for making embroidered speakers (threads, clothing materials, and coil size). Anandghan and I also designed several circuits for speakers and microphones. Since we are still working on the project, I cannot show much detail on the website. Chat with me about the project!
