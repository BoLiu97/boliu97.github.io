Can we use several speakers embroidered on clothes to track body movement? In this project, I experimented with many materials for making embroidered speakers (threads, clothing materials, and coil size). Anandghan and I also designed several circuits for speakers and microphones. Since we are still working on the project, I cannot show much detail on the website. Chat with me about the project!
